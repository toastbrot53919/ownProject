waypoints in the array, at which point the unit may either loop back to the beginning of the array or stop patrol behavior altogether.

The script overrides the EnterState, UpdateState, and ExitState methods from the parent AIState class. In the EnterState method, the script sets the current waypoint index to 0 and sets the unit's destination to the first waypoint. In the UpdateState method, the script checks if the unit has reached its current destination and sets a new destination if necessary. In the ExitState method, no logic is implemented.

Overall, the PatrolStateMonoBehaviour.cs script is responsible for managing patrol waypoints for an AI-controlled player unit in a Unity game. This script overrides the EnterState, UpdateState, and ExitState methods from the parent AIState class. In the EnterState method, the script sets the current waypoint index to 0 and sets the unit's destination to the first waypoint in the array. The UpdateState method checks if the unit has reached its current destination and sets a new destination if necessary. The ExitState method has no implemented logic. The unit may loop back to the beginning of the array or stop patrol behavior altogether when it reaches the end of the array of waypoints or if the game has ended.
