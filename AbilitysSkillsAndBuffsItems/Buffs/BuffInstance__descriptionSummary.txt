The BuffInstance class defines a buff instance with its properties and methods. This class has a Buff object, GameObject for target, currentStacks, remainingDuration, and StatsModifier for characterStatsTarget as its properties. It also has a BuffSystem object buffSystemCaster for the caster of the buff. The BuffInstance constructor initializes these properties with the given arguments. The Update() method decreases remainingDuration and calls OnBuffFade() if it is less than or equal to zero. The Refresh() method sets remainingDuration to the given argument. The AddStack() method increases currentStacks and calls OnBuffApply(). The OnBuffApply() method performs actions and applies stat changes when the buff is applied, and it calls the corresponding events. OnBuffFade() and OnBuffHit() methods perform actions or apply effects based on their names, and calls their corresponding events. The BuffInstance class manages and updates a single instance of a buff on a target.
