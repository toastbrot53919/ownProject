The file Item.cs in the AbilitysSkillsAndBuffsItems folder within the Assets folder contains two classes: Item and EquipableItem. Item is an abstract class that stores the name, description, and icon of the item, while EquipableItem stores bonuses to different stats that the item provides when equipped, in addition to a subStatsModifier property that modifies the stats of the character. These classes define the basic properties and bonuses for in-game items.
