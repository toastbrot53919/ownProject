The file name is Item.cs, and it is located in the AbilitysSkillsAndBuffsItems folder within the Assets folder in the project. This file contains two classes: Item and EquipableItem.

The Item class is an abstract class that extends ScriptableObject. It has three public variables: itemName, description, and icon. These store the name, description, and icon of the item, respectively. This class is intended to be inherited by other classes that represent specific items in the game.

The EquipableItem, on the other hand, is a serializable class that also extends ScriptableObject. It has six public variables: equipmentType, strengthBonus, intelligenceBonus, dexterityBonus, enduranceBonus, and wisdomBonus. These variables store the bonuses to different stats that the item provides when equipped. The EquipManager.EquipmentType enumeration determines the type of equipment the item represents.

Moreover, EquipableItem includes a subStatsModifier property that stores an object of the StatsModifier class. It is used to modify the stats of the character when the item is equipped.

Overall, both Item and EquipableItem classes define the basic properties and bonuses for in-game items, with EquipableItem class having more specific properties for equipped items.
