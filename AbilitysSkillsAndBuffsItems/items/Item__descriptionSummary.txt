This code defines two classes: an abstract class called "Item" and a serializable class called "EquipableItem" that inherits from the "Item" class. The "Item" class is a ScriptableObject and has three public fields: "itemName," "description," and "icon," which define the name, description, and icon of an item. The "EquipableItem" class also has these three fields and includes additional fields for defining stats modifiers such as "strengthBonus" and "intelligenceBonus," as well as an "equipmentType" field for defining the type of equipment the item is. The class also includes a "subStatsModifier" field for more complex stats modifications.
