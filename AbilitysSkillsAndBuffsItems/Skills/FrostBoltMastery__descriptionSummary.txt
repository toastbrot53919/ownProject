This code creates a skill called FrostBoltMastery, which applies a "Frozen" buff with a duration of 5 seconds and a stun effect of 10 seconds to a target. It also checks for an existing "Chill" buff on the target, and if the number of stacks reaches the maximum, applies the "Frozen" buff instead and removes the "Chill" buff. The "OnApplyFrozen" function is called when the "Frozen" buff is applied and applies the stun effect to the target. The skill is added to the player's stats when applied and removed when the skill is removed.
