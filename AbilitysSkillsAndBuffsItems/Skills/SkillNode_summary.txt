The file name is SkillNode.cs and it is located in the Assets/Scripts/AbilitysSkillsAndBuffsItems/Skills folder. This file contains the logic for a skill node in a skill tree. It is a ScriptableObject that can be created and customized in the Unity Editor with the help of CreateAssetMenu attribute. 

Each SkillNode has several properties such as skillName, skillDescription, skillPointCost, icon, mainStatRequirement, and mainStatValue, skill, prerequisiteSkill, and isUnlocked. These properties represent the necessary details about a specific skill in the game. For example, skillName refers to the name of the skill, skillPointCost refers to how many skill points you need to unlock it, and mainStatRequirement is a list of requirements, the player has to fulfill in order to unlock the skill, and so on.

The skill node has a list of Archetypes which represent a group of characters or classes. The Archetype list is used to check if the player's current Archetype satisfies the mainStatRequirement. The mainStatValue list represents the value of the mainStatRequirement that needs to be achieved by the character before they can unlock the skill.

One important property is the skill which represents the actual behavior of the skill. The Skill property can be defined as a class that contains all of the logic and functionality for the skill. 

Another property is the prerequisiteSkill that represents the skill that must be unlocked before the current skill can be unlocked. This is useful for creating a skill tree with a progression system where the player has to move through a sequence of skills to unlock more powerful ones.

Finally, the isUnlocked property is a boolean that indicates whether the player has unlocked the skill yet or not.

Overall, the SkillNode.cs file is a crucial component in creating a skill tree system in a game.
