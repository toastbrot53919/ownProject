This code defines a SkillNodeFactory class that creates and returns a new SkillNode object based on the input data provided by a SkillNodeFactoryDataClass object. The SkillNodeFactoryDataClass contains various properties such as skill name, description, and point cost, along with an icon, main stat requirements, and a skill object. The SkillNodeFactory's CreateSkillNode method initializes a new SkillNode object with the provided data and saves it as an asset in the Assets/Resources/SkillNodes directory.
