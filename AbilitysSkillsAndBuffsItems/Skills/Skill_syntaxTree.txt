Syntax Tree:
- abstract class Skill : ScriptableObject
  - public string skillName
  - public List<Archetype> archTypes
  - public StatsModifier statModifier
  - public virtual void ApplySkill(CharacterStats characterStats)
    - Debug.Log("Applying skill: " + skillName)
    - // Implement skill-specific behavior in derived classes
  - public virtual void RemoveSkill(CharacterStats characterStats)
    - Debug.Log("Removing skill: " + skillName)
    - // Implement skill-specific behavior in derived classes
  - public virtual void OnSpawnAbilityObject(AbilityObject abilityObject, AbilityData abilityData)
    - // no implementation
- enum Archetype
  - Strength
  - Intelligence 
  - Dexterity
  - Endurance 
  - Wisdom

Explanation:
- The Skill class is an abstract class that inherits from ScriptableObject.
- It has three public properties: skillName, archTypes (which is a list of Archetype enum), and statModifier (which is a StatsModifier object).
- It has three virtual methods that can be overridden by derived classes: ApplySkill, RemoveSkill, and OnSpawnAbilityObject.
- The ApplySkill and RemoveSkill methods are empty in the base class but can be implemented in derived classes to provide skill-specific behavior.
- The OnSpawnAbilityObject method has no implementation in the base class.
- The Archetype enum is defined with five values: Strength, Intelligence, Dexterity, Endurance, and Wisdom.
