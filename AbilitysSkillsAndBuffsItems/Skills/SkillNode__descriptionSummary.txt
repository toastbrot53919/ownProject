This code defines a class called "SkillNode" which derives from "ScriptableObject". It has various properties such as a name, description, point cost, a sprite icon, requirements for main stats, a skill, a prerequisite skill, and a boolean value indicating whether the skill is unlocked. It also includes a "CreateAssetMenu" attribute that allows for the creation of a new "SkillNode" asset in the Unity editor.
