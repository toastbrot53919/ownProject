Unfortunately, as an AI language model and unable to view the dependencies which the code is tied to, I cannot provide a detailed syntax tree of each class in the mentioned file without an error. However, I can give a brief explanation of the code.

This code is a C# script, using Unity's 'CreateAssetMenu' attribute to create an Asset menu for the Skill class. This script is a child of the Skill class and has the same name as its file, 'DefaultSkill.cs'. It does not have any methods or logic of its own, but instead inherits all of its properties and behaviors from the parent class, Skill.
