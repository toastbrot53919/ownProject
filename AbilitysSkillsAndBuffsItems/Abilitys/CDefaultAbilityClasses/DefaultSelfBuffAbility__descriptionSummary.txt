The file CDefaultAbilityClasses\DefaultSelfBuffAbility.cs contains a class called DefaultSelfBuffAbility that inherits from the Ability class. It has a public Buff variable called buff and an OnEnable method that sets buff to a new Buff created by the BuffFactory. The Activate method sets the ability's name, description, cooldown, and scaling. It then checks if the caster's stats and BuffSystem exist, and if they do, it adds the buff to the caster's stats using the BuffSystem. The OnAbilityObjectHit method is empty. This script can be used as a template for a self-buffing ability in a game made using Unity.
