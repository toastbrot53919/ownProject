This code is a class named "DefaultAbility" that inherits from a base class called "Ability." The file is located at "C:\Users\Toastbrot\Downloads\STRATEGY 01.04.2022\My project\Assets\Scripts\AbilitysSkillsAndBuffsItems\Abilitys\CDefaultAbilityClasses\DefaultAbility.cs." 

In the Awake method, the ability's name and description are set to "Default." 

The OnEnable method checks if BaseAbilityStats, TotalAbilityStats, and abilityModifierManager are null and instantiates them if they are. It then calls the updateAbilityStats method. 

The Activate method prints out a message to the console saying "Default Ability." 

The OnAbilityObjectHit method takes in an abilityObject and a target GameObject but does not perform any actions.
