This code defines a default aura ability that can be activated. It inherits from a default ability class and has a set of unique properties, such as a prefab for the aura and a damage interval. Upon activation, it instantiates the aura prefab and sets it as the ability object. The ability object can deal damage to the target after a certain time interval, and the ability can be deactivated.
