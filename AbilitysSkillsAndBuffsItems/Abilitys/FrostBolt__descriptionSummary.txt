The file "FrostBolt.cs" contains a class named "FrostBolt" which is a sub-class of "DefaultProjectileAbility". It creates a "chillBuff" of type Buff and sets its properties to reduce the movement and attack speed of the target. It also sets the ability name and description. When the ability is activated, it calls the base class method. When the ability object hits a target, it deals damage and applies the chillBuff to the target using BuffSystem if the target has HealthController component and BuffSystem.
