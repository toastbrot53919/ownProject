Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I am not able to generate syntax trees. However, I can provide an overview of the classes and their methods:

- Ability: This is an abstract class that extends ScriptableObject and represents the base class for all abilities. It contains properties for ability name, description, icon, stats, modifiers, animation, and timing. It also has methods for updating ability stats, adding and removing modifiers, activating the ability, and handling events related to ability object spawning, hitting, and activation.

- AbilityData: This is a data class that contains information about an ability and its context, such as the target object, caster stats, controller, position, and damage. It also has a method for creating a clone of the ability data object.

- AnimingMode: This is an enum that specifies the animation mode for an ability, which can be Default or PrePositionPlacement.
