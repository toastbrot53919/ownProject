The "FireBall" script is a subclass of "DefaultProjectileAbility" that represents a fireball ability in a game. It has two methods: "OnAbilityObjectHit" and "Activate." The former is called when the fireball hits a target, and it checks if the caster's stats are not null and if the target has a health controller. If so, it calculates the damage and calls the "TakeDamage" method on the health controller. It then raises an event indicating that the object was hit. The latter method is called when the ability is activated, and it instantiates a projectile prefab at the caster's fire point, giving it a speed and direction. It sets the ability object's parent to itself and sets the ability data's projectile speed. Finally, it raises an event indicating that the object was spawned.
