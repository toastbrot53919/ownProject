The file located at "C:\Users\Toastbrot\Downloads\STRATEGY 01.04.2022\My project\Assets\Scripts\AbilitysSkillsAndBuffsItems\Abilitys\CDefaultAbilityObejcts\BaseProjectileObject.cs" contains a class called "BaseProjectileObject" that extends the "AbilityObject" class and implements the "IBouncingAbilityObject" and "IPiercingAbilityObject" interfaces. It has properties for "BounceIntensity" and "BounceDuration", as well as fields for "bounceCount" and "pierceCount". The method "HandleOnHit" is overridden to apply damage to the target and trigger either bounce or pierce logic based on the values of "bounceCount" and "pierceCount". The methods "Bounce" and "Pierce" are implemented to handle the specific bounce and pierce logic, respectively.
