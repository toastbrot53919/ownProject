This is the code for a Shield Bash ability in a game. The code is saved in the file "ShieldBash.cs" and is located in the path "C:\Users\Toastbrot\Downloads\STRATEGY 01.04.2022\My project\Assets\Scripts\AbilitysSkillsAndBuffsItems\Abilitys\". The ability is a subclass of a DefaultAbility class and is created as a new asset menu item. The Shield Bash ability has a prefabAbilityObject, which is the object that will be instantiated when the ability is used. The Awake() method sets up the ability's stats, damage, scaling, animation, and stun duration. 

The OnAbilityObjectHit() method is called when the ability object hits a target. If the ability object's caster stats are not null, it applies damage and stun to the target. The Activate() method is called when the ability is activated. The method instantiates the prefabAbilityObject and sets its velocity towards the forward direction of the caster. Finally, it sets the ability data and assigns the stun duration to the ability object's data.
