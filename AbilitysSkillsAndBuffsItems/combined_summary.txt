class that defines abilities with properties and methods. The `DefaultSkill` class provides a default skill that can be used as a template for others. The `FireBall` and `SimpleStrike` classes inherit from `DefaultSkill` and represent specific abilities with different properties and effects. The `MeleeStrikeObject` and `BaseProjectileObject` classes inherit from `AbilityObject` and provide functionality for handling hit logic and creating a projectile object. The `DefaultProjectileAbility` script provides a default projectile ability that can be used as a base for others. Finally, the `ShieldBash` script defines an ability called "Shield Bash". 

The `BuffInstance` class represents an instance of a buff and contains information such as the time remaining and the source of the buff. The `Buff` script defines the properties and events of a buff object, including when it is applied and removed. 

The `SkillNode` class defines a node in a skill tree, which can be unlocked and provide bonuses or new abilities. The `Skill` abstract class provides a framework for creating and managing skills in a skill tree. The `Archetype` enum provides different archetype types for skills and abilities. 

Overall, these classes provide a variety of functionality related to character stats, skill trees, and game abilities in a Unity project. s: duration, effect, source, and target. It also has a constructor that takes in a source and target object, and a method for updating the duration of the buff. This class is used to apply various buffs to game objects. The Buff object class has variables for stacks and duration, and methods for refreshing, adding/removing stacks, and triggering events when applied, faded, or hit. Another script defines properties and bonuses for in-game items, with more specific properties for equipped items. The FireballMasterySkill.cs script defines behavior for a specific skill in a game, and can be created as an asset through the Unity Editor. The SkillNodeFactory.cs and SkillNode.cs files are important for creating a skill tree system in a game. The Skill.cs file contains an abstract class defining skill-specific behavior and an enum for archetype types.

Class Name: IStatsProvider.cs
- Contains an interface called "IStatsProvider"
- Has a single method called "GetCharacterStats()" which returns an object of type "CharacterStats"
- Provides a mechanism for getting stats related to a character object in a Unity project
- Plays a crucial role in managing character stats within the game

Class Name: SkillTree.cs
- A script for implementing a skill tree in a game
- Inherits from the "ScriptableObject" class, allowing it to be created as an asset in the Unity editor
- Defines a list of "skillNodes," which are objects representing individual skills in the skill tree
- Contains methods for adding new skill nodes to the list and resetting all nodes to their default state
- Provides an "IsVisible" internal method for potential use in determining if a skill node should be shown to the player
- Upon instantiation, initializes all skill nodes as locked

Class Name: StatsModifier.cs
- Contains a class called "StatsModifier"
- Class has float variables representing different stats and two public methods "Add" and "Sub"
- Used to modify a character's stats by creating a StatsModifier object with desired changes and applying it to the character's existing stats
- Useful for implementing buffs or debuffs, as well as for calculating the effects of equipment or abilities
- Add and Sub methods make it easy to stack or remove multiple modifiers

Class Name: AbilityControllData.cs
- Contains a script called "AbilityControllData"
- Used to control abilities in the game
- Contains four public variables: "type", "direction", "target", and "targetPosition"
- Essential for managing abilities in the game and provides easy access to ability-related information.

The AbilityObject.cs file defines a class for ability objects, which has properties for events during different stages of its lifecycle, a boolean for whether it should destroy itself, an AbilityData property, and interfaces for bouncing, piercing, and homing. The HandleOnHit, Update, HandleOnSpawn, and HandleOnDelete methods are used to manage the object's behavior.

The Ability.cs file defines an abstract class for abilities with various attributes like abilityName and baseDamage, and abstract methods OnAbilityObjectHit and Activate that subclasses must implement. It also has protected virtual methods for overriding in subclasses to add functionality to activation. The class declares several delegate types and events for use within the ability system, and a public AbilityData class for carrying ability-related information.

BaseProjectileObject.cs: This class represents a base projectile object that can bounce off surfaces and pierce through targets. It contains properties for determining its bouncing and piercing behavior and has methods for handling hitting a target, bouncing, and piercing.

DefaultProjectileAbility.cs: This script creates a default projectile ability in Unity, with a public variable for the projectile's prefab and speed, and methods for activating the projectile and handling its collision with a target.

DefaultSkill.cs: This script utilizes the Unity engine to create a new asset menu item called "Skill" with a sub-menu called "Skill," and provides a framework for creating new skills in the game.

"FireBall.cs" is a script used for a fireball ability in a Unity game that inherits from the "DefaultProjectileAbility" class. It defines the logic for activating the ability and when it hits an object. 

"ShieldBash.cs" is a script for an ability called "Shield Bash" in a game that inherits from a base class named "Ability". It defines the properties and behavior of this ability, including the prefabAbilityObject, stunDuration, damage, and animation. It also defines the method for when the ability object hits a target and when the ability is activated.

The "SimpleStrike.cs" class is a subclass of the "Ability" class that instantiates a game object upon activation and deals damage to a target's health. The "BuffInstance.cs" class represents an instance of a buff in a game, with variables for the buff, target, stacks, and duration, and methods for adding and removing stacks and updating the duration. The "Buff.cs" script is a ScriptableObject that defines the properties and events of a buff object, with methods to trigger those events.

"Item.cs" is a script that contains an abstract class "Item" and a serializable class "EquipableItem". "Item" has three public variables that store the name, description, and icon of the item, while "EquipableItem" has six public variables that store the bonuses to different stats that the item provides when equipped, as well as a subStatsModifier property to modify character stats. 

"FireballMasterySkill.cs" is a script that defines the behavior and logic for the "FireBallMastery" skill in a Unity game. It is derived from the base class "Skill" and contains a serialized field "explosionPrefab" and two methods "ApplySkill" and "RemoveSkill". The script applies damage to targets within a specified radius and instantiates an explosion at the hit position when an object is hit by the fireball.

The SkillNodeFactory.cs allows for easy creation and management of SkillNode objects with specific properties. SkillNode.cs is a ScriptableObject containing the logic for a skill node in a skill tree with several properties such as skillName, skillDescription, and is used to create a skill tree system in a game. Skill.cs is an abstract class with various parameters such as skill name and archetype types, and includes methods that can be overridden to implement skill-specific behavior in derived classes and an enum for archetype types.
