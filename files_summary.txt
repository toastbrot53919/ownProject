Overall, the purpose of the StatsModifier class is to simplify the modification of statistical attributes in a game or application by providing a standardized and organized approach. It allows developers to easily add or subtract values related to attack, defense, and other attributes, which can be useful for balancing gameplay or creating dynamic systems. It is a serializable class, which means that its data can be saved and loaded between sessions. The Add and Sub methods make it easy to combine different StatsModifiers for specific situations or conditions.
