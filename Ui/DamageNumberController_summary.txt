File Name: DamageNumberController.cs

This file contains the implementation of the DamageNumberController component which displays damage numbers in a game. It has a public TextMeshPro field that stores the text to be displayed, a floatSpeed field that determines the speed at which the number floats upwards, and a duration field that determines how long the number stays on the screen.

The Update() method updates the position of the number by moving it upwards using the floatSpeed field, rotates the number to face the camera, applies a fade effect based on the elapsed time and duration, and destroys the game object after the duration.

The FaceCamera() method calculates the direction to the camera, sets its y-component to zero, and rotates the number to face the camera.

The SetDamageValue() method sets the text field of the TextMeshPro component to the damage value passed as a parameter, while ensuring that the component is not null.

The Start() method assigns the main camera to the playerCamera field. If the TextMeshPro component is not assigned in the DamageNumberController component, an error message is displayed and the function returns. If the TextMeshPro component is null, the game object is destroyed, and the function returns.
