File Name: GameManager.cs

Summary: The GameManager class is responsible for managing the overall game state and other systems as needed. It uses an enum called GameState to keep track of the current state of the game. The class also provides methods to change the game state and save or load the game.

Internals: The class has a static instance variable to ensure there is only one instance of the GameManager in the game. The Awake method initializes the game state and other systems as needed, and ensures that only one instance of the game manager exists in the game by destroying any additional instances. The Update method calls HandleGameState and UpdateCursorVisibility functions. 

The UpdateCursorVisibility method handles when to show or hide the cursor based on the current game state. If the game is paused or in a menu, the cursor is shown but if the game is playing, the cursor is hidden. 

The HandleGameState method uses a switch statement to handle the different game states (InMenu, Playing, Paused, GameOver), and performs the necessary logic for each state.

The class provides public methods to change the current game state and to save and load the game. Other methods can also be added as needed for additional functionality.
