The SpellBookUiController.cs file is responsible for managing the user interface (UI) elements related to a player's learned abilities or spells. 

This script contains several public TMP_Text and GameObject variables, which are references to the UI elements that display the ability's name and description, as well as a list of learned abilities shown in a scrollable view. 

The UpdateQuestList() method is used to populate the list of abilities in the scrollable content area. First, it clears any existing content by destroying all the child game objects of the UI parent element. Then, it creates new instances of the ability list item prefab for each ability the player has learned, sets its name using the ability's name property, and attaches a button listener so that when this UI item is clicked, it triggers the ShowAbilityInformation() method with the corresponding ability as a parameter. 

The ShowAbilityInformation() method sets the titleText and descriptionText UI elements to the corresponding values from the ability's properties. Additionally, it generates a string variable called info that contains various information about the ability, such as base damage, strength scaling, intelligence scaling, and cooldown. This information is then displayed in the objectivesText UI element. 

Overall, this script provides a simple interface for players to view their learned abilities and their associated details.
