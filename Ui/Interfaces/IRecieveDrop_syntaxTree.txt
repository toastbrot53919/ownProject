File: IRecieveDrop.cs

Syntax tree:
- using UnityEngine.EventSystems;
- using UnityEngine;
- public interface IRecieveDrop : IPointerEnterHandler, IPointerExitHandler, IDropHandler
  - { }
    - internal void OnPointerEnter(PointerEventData eventData);
    - internal void OnPointerExit(PointerEventData eventData);
    - internal void OnDrop(PointerEventData eventData);

Internal logic:
- The interface IRecieveDrop is defined and inherits from three event handler interfaces: IPointerEnterHandler, IPointerExitHandler, and IDropHandler.
- The interface does not contain any additional methods or properties.
- The three inherited methods are declared with the "internal" access modifier, which means they can only be accessed within the same assembly (in this case, the Unity project).
- The OnPointerEnter method is called when the cursor enters the area of the UI element that implements this interface.
- The OnPointerExit method is called when the cursor exits the area of the UI element that implements this interface.
- The OnDrop method is called when a draggable UI element is dropped onto the UI element that implements this interface. The eventData parameter contains information about the drop, such as the position of the drop and the dragged UI element.
