This code contains a C# interface named IDragable that is located in the file path C:\Users\Toastbrot\Downloads\STRATEGY 01.04.2022\My project\Assets\Scripts\Ui\Interfaces\IDragable.cs. The interface extends from three Event System interfaces: IBeginDragHandler, IDragHandler, and IEndDragHandler. The interface declares one method, getDraggedObject(), which returns a GameObject. This interface likely serves as a blueprint for any Unity game objects that need to be draggable in the game. The methods from the Event System interfaces allow for proper handling of drag events during gameplay.
