The `PresentQuestUiController` class has four instance variables: `questTitle`, `questDescription`, `acceptButton`, and `declineButton` of type `TMP_Text`, `TMP_Text`, `Button`, and `Button`, respectively. 

There is also an instance variable `questSystem` of type `QuestSystem`. 

The class has a `Start()` method that sets `questSystem` to the result of `FindObjectOfType<QuestSystem>()`.

There is also a public method `showQuestInfo(Quest quest,UIButtonManager UIManager)` that takes a `Quest` object and a `UIManager` object as arguments. Inside this method, `questTitle`'s `text` field is set to the `title` field of the `quest` argument and `questDescription`'s `text` field is set to the `description` field of the `quest` argument.

The `acceptButton` is set to add two event listeners: one that calls `AddQuest(quest)` on `questSystem` and another that calls `hideQuestUiPresenter()` on `UIManager`. The `declineButton` is also set to add a single event listener that calls `hideQuestUiPresenter()` on `UIManager`.
