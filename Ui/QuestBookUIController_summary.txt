File name: QuestBookUIController.cs

Summary: 

This script is responsible for controlling the UI elements of the player's quest book. It has references to various UI elements such as text fields, scroll rect, and a prefab for the quest list item. It also has access to the quest system, which stores all the available quests and their objectives. 

The script has two main functions: UpdateQuestList and ShowQuestInformation. The UpdateQuestList function clears the quest list content and repopulates it with the current available quests. The ShowQuestInformation function displays the details of the selected quest, such as its title, description, and objectives. 

To clear the quest list content, the script loops through all the child objects of the questListContent and calls the Destroy function on each of them. To repopulate the quest list content, the script creates a new game object using the questListItemPrefab and sets its text field to the title of the current quest. It also adds a listener to the button component of the game object so that it can display the details of the selected quest when clicked. 

Finally, the scroll position of the quest list is reset to the top. The ShowQuestInformation function sets the text fields of the title, description, and objectives to the selected quest's data. It loops through all the objectives of the quest and displays their progress in a string format. 

Overall, the QuestBookUIController script is an essential component of the player's quest book interface, enabling them to view and track their progress in the available quests.
