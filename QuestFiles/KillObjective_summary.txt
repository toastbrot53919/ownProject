File Name: KillObjective.cs

This script defines a class called KillObjective, which is a subclass of QuestObjective. It contains three serialized fields: enemyId (string), targetKills (int), and currentKills (int) which represent the unique identifier of the enemy, the number of enemies to be killed, and the current number of enemies killed, respectively.

The KillObjective class has a constructor that takes in an id (string), description (string), enemyId (string), and targetKills (int) as parameters to initialize the instance variables.

The script also overrides three methods from the QuestObjective superclass: UpdateProgress(), GetObjectiveProgress(), and IsCompleted(). 

UpdateProgress() takes in a killedEnemyId (string) parameter and updates the currentKills count if the killedEnemyId matches the id of the enemy specified in enemyId. If the number of currentKills reaches the targetKills, then the status is marked as completed.

GetObjectiveProgress() returns a string that represents the current number of kills and the target number of kills.

IsCompleted() returns a boolean indicating whether the status of the objective is completed or not.

The script uses the Unity Debug.LogError() method to print out the current number of kills for debugging purposes. The script also explicitly uses the UnityEngine namespace.
