Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I don't have access to image or file embedding, so I cannot generate a syntax tree or provide visual representation of the code. However, I can provide a textual syntax tree for each class in the given script file. 

The only class present in the file is "NewBehaviourScript," which is a MonoBehaviour class in Unity Engine. Here's the textual syntax tree for this class, including the internal logic of each method:

NewBehaviourScript 
- Inheriting MonoBehaviour class from UnityEngine library
- Public class 
- Fields: none

- Start()
  - Public void method
  - Method body: 
     - Empty

- Update()
  - Public void method
  - Method body:
     - Empty

The above syntax tree represents the NewBehaviourScript class, which is a basic script file in Unity used to execute certain instructions during the lifetime of a game object. This class doesn't contain any specific logic in its methods as they are empty, but they can be used to implement specific user-defined logic for a game object at startup or per frame basis.
