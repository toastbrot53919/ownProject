File Name: QuestSystem.cs

Summary: This file contains the implementation of the QuestSystem class, which is responsible for managing quests in the game. It contains functions to add, remove and update quests. It also has a function to get a quest by its ID. 

Internally, the class uses a List to store all the quests, with each quest being an instance of the Quest class. When a quest is added, it is simply added to the list. When removing a quest, the Quest with the matching ID is found using the Find() function and then removed from the list.

To update quest objectives, the UpdateQuestObjective() function loops through all quests and calls the CheckAndUpdateObjectives() function on each quest that is not completed.

Overall, the QuestSystem class provides a simple and efficient way to manage quests in a game.
