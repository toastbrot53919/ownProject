This code defines a class called "Calculator" containing methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The class takes two input parameters and returns the result of the respective calculation. The expected input for each method is two numerical values, and the output is a numerical value representing the result of the calculation. 

Class: Calculator 

Methods: 
- add(x: int, y: int) -> int 
- subtract(x: int, y: int) -> int 
- multiply(x: int, y: int) -> int 
- divide(x: int, y: int) -> float 

Expected Input: 
- x, y: two numerical values for each method 

Output:
- a numerical value representing the result of the calculation
