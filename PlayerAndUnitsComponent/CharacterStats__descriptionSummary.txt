This is a Unity C# script for defining character stats in a video game. It contains main stats such as strength, intelligence, dexterity, endurance, and wisdom, and sub-stats such as critical chance, critical damage, attack speed, spell critical chance, spell critical damage, cooldown, max life, max mana, life regen, mana regen, armor, magic resistance, and dodge chance. It also has the ability to add or remove unspent stat points from the main stats and calculate sub-stats based on main stats and equipment bonuses. The script also uses other game objects such as EquipManager, SkillController, BuffSystem, HealthController, and ManaController to initialize and update the character stats.

The file "CharacterStats.cs" contains a Unity C# script for defining character stats in a video game. The script includes main stats such as strength, intelligence, dexterity, endurance, and wisdom, and sub-stats such as critical chance, critical damage, attack speed, spell critical chance, spell critical damage, cooldown, max life, max mana, life regen, mana regen, armor, magic resistance, and dodge chance. There is a method called "IncreaseStat" that increases the specified main stat by a given amount, as long as there are enough unspent stat points available, and updates the sub-stats accordingly. There is also a method called "SetStats" that sets all of the character's main stats to those of another "CharacterStats" object and retrieves the object's "EquipManager" component to update sub-stats. The script is able to add or remove unspent stat points from the main stats and calculate sub-stats based on main stats and equipment bonuses. The script utilizes other game objects such as EquipManager, SkillController, BuffSystem, HealthController, and ManaController to initialize and update the character stats.
