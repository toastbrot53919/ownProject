File Name: PlayerController.cs

The PlayerController class in Unity is responsible for controlling the character movement, camera, jumping, and handling hotkeys for abilities and items. 

The class contains the following components:
- BuffSystem: A system for managing buffs
- ExperienceSystem: A system for managing experience points
- CharacterStats: A component for managing character stats such as strength, intelligence, and endurance
- CharacterCombatController: A controller for managing character combat 
- SkillController: A controller for managing player's skills
- SkillTree: A component for managing the skill tree
- IStunnable: An interface for checking whether the character is stunned

The class also contains the following public variables:
- moveSpeed: A float value for character movement speed
- rotationSpeed: A float value for character rotation speed
- jumpForce: A float value for the force applied for jumping
- groundLayer: A layer mask for detecting ground

Additionally, the class has private variables for managing character movement, camera rotation, and hotkeys. It also uses the Animator component and a Rigidbody for character movement.

The Start() function is responsible for initializing the various components and hotkeys. It also subscribes to the OnSkillUnlocked event in the SkillController component.

The Update() function handles character movement, jumping, camera rotation, and hotkeys. It calls the HandleMovement(), HandleJump(), HandleCamera(), and HandleHotkey() functions respectively.

The HandleHotkey() function is responsible for checking and performing abilities or items assigned to hotkeys using the KeyCode value of each hotkey.

The HandleMovement() function retrieves input values for character movement and sets the character's rotation according to the input direction.

The HandleJump() function checks and applies force for jumping if the character is on the ground.

The HandleCamera() function retrieves input values for camera rotation and sets the camera position and rotation accordingly.

The FixedUpdate() function is used for applying motion to the Rigidbody component for character movement.

The class also contains a method for unlocking and unlearning skill nodes in the SkillTree component.
