The file AnimationController.cs is a script for controlling animations and visual effects for a player or units in Unity. It contains a serialized Animator component and a list of VisualEffectData objects. The Awake() method initializes a dictionary of visual effects using the names and prefabs from the VisualEffectData list. The PlayAnimation() method plays the specified animation using the Animator component, with an additional check for the "attack" animation which is triggered instead. Finally, the ApplyVisualEffect() method instantiates a visual effect at a given position and rotation using the visualEffects dictionary. If the specified effect is not found in the dictionary, a warning message is displayed.
