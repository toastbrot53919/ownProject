The HealthController.cs script defines a health controller for characters in a Unity game. It uses a private CharacterStats variable and has public variables for the character's name, maximum health, current health, and a damage text prefab. The script includes methods to update the maximum health, update the current health, take damage, and show damage numbers. The Start method initializes the character's max and current health, finds the damage text prefab, and adds the character to the global unit controller. The TakeDamage method subtracts the given damage from the character's current health and shows damage numbers. If the current health drops to 0 or less, the Die method is called, which removes the character from the global unit controller and destroys the character GameObject. If the character is killed by an object with a QuestSystem component, the UpdateQuestObjective method is called. The ShowDamageNumbers method instantiates damage numbers on a WorldSpaceCanvasController.
