The file "HotkeyController.cs" contains a script in Unity that handles the hotkeys for a player and units. It includes a list of hotkeys, a combat controller, and a dictionary that maps the hotkeys to their respective abilities. 

In the Start function, the script initializes the hotkeys list with a capacity of nine, and populates the dictionary with the corresponding hotkeys. Additionally, it assigns a test ability to the first hotkey in the list. 

In the Update function, the script calls the HandleHotkey function which checks for a key press from the player. If a hotkey is mapped to the pressed key and is assigned an ability, the script performs the ability using the combat controller. 

The Hotkey class defines a hotkey object that contains an ability.
