This script is called "Inventory" and is located in the directory "C:\Users\Toastbrot\Downloads\STRATEGY 01.04.2022\My project\Assets\Scripts\PlayerAndUnitsComponent\". It includes a class with the same name that inherits from MonoBehaviour. The class has a public List of items and a reference to a QuestSystem. 

The Start() method initializes the questSystem reference by getting the QuestSystem component from the current game object. 

The AddItem() method takes an Item parameter, adds it to the items list, and then checks if questSystem is not null. If it is not null, it logs a message to the console and calls the UpdateQuestObjective() method of the questSystem with the ID of the collected item. 

The RemoveItem() method takes an Item parameter and removes it from the items list. 

The HasItem() method takes an Item parameter and returns a boolean indicating whether the item is in the items list.
