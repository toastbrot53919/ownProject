This code defines an AnimationController class that handles animations and visual effects for a character in a game. The class has a serialized Animator object and lists of serialized VisualEffectData and animationDelay objects. It also has several constants defining strings for specific animation names.

During Awake() initialization, the class creates a dictionary of visual effects mapped to their names, using the list of VisualEffectData. 

The class has several public methods: setAnimatorVariable() sets an animator variable based on a specified name and value, PlayAnimation() plays an animation (either by triggering an "attack" animation or playing the animation specified by the given animationName), and ApplyVisualEffect() instantiates a specified visual effect at a given position and rotation.

The class also has private helper methods: initAnimationDelays() initializes the list of animation delays, and returnAnimationDelay() returns the delay time for a specified animation name.

Finally, the code includes two Serializable classes: VisualEffectData (containing a visual effect name and prefab) and animationDelay (containing an animation name and delay time).
