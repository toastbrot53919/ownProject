  - The IInteractable interface defines a single method named Interact that takes in a Transform object named interacter as a parameter. This method is public, meaning it can be accessed from other classes and interfaces.
  
  - The Interact method has no return type, meaning it does not return any values. When called, this method will perform some action related to interacting with an object, as defined by the implementation of the class that implements this interface. The interacter parameter is a Transform object that represents the entity that is performing the interaction. This parameter may be used by the implementing class to determine how the interaction will be carried out.
