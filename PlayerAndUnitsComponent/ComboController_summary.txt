The file name is ComboController.cs. It contains two classes, ComboController and ComboCounter. ComboController has a List of ComboCounters, which is initialized in its constructor. The UpdateComboController method loops through all the ComboCounters in the list, calling their UpdateComboCounter method. The IncreaseComboCounter method takes a string parameter, which represents the name of the combo to be increased. It loops through all the ComboCounters in the list, checking if the ComboName matches the input string. If it does, it calls the IncreaseComboCounter method of that ComboCounter. If it doesn't find a match, it creates a new ComboCounter with a comboCounter of 1. The GetComboCounter method also takes a string parameter for the name of the combo to retrieve. It loops through the ComboCounters, checking for a match and returning the comboCounter of the matching ComboCounter. If no match is found, it returns 0. ComboCounter has a ComboName, comboCounter, comboTimer, and comboTimeLimit variables. Its constructor sets the comboTimeLimit and initializes comboCounter and comboTimer to 0. The UpdateComboCounter method adds Time.deltaTime to comboTimer, and if comboTimer exceeds comboTimeLimit, comboCounter is reset to 0. IncreaseComboCounter increments comboCounter and sets comboTimer to 0. The GetComboCounter method returns the comboCounter value. ResetComboCounter resets comboCounter and comboTimer to 0.
