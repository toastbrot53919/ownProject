This code defines a CharacterCombatController class that implements the IStatsProvider interface and contains references to several other controllers, including AbilityController, AnimationController, ComboController, and IStunnable. The Start method initializes these controllers and the characterStats reference. The class also includes a StopAbility method that calls a method in the AbilityController to stop a specific ability, and a PerformAbility method that performs an ability on a target GameObject, calculating damage based on the character's stats and ability stats, applying critical hits, and setting cooldowns. The class also includes a GetCharacterStats method that returns the characterStats reference.
