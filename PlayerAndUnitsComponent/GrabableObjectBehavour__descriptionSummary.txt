This code defines the behavior of an object that can be grabbed and interacted with in Unity. The object can be grabbed by setting its "IsGrabbed" property to true and assigning the grabbing object's transform to its "Grabber" property. When grabbed, the object is parented to the transform of a "CanGrabController" component on the grabbing object and its local position and rotation are set to zero. The object can be released by setting its "IsGrabbed" property to false and clearing its "Grabber" property. When interacted with, the object checks if it is currently grabbed. If it is, it releases itself. If it is not, it is grabbed by the interacting object.
