The file called "IInteractable.cs" contains an interface called IInteractable. This interface requires any implementing class to have a method called "Interact()" which does not return any value. This interface is used to ensure any unit or player character in the game that needs to be interacted with by the player, can be interacted with using the same method name "Interact()". The logic behind the "Interact()" method will be defined in each implementing class.
