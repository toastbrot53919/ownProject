The file located at C:\Users\Toastbrot\Downloads\STRATEGY 01.04.2022\My project\Assets\Scripts\PlayerAndUnitsComponent\AiStates\AttackState.cs contains a class named AttackState that inherits from a base class AIState. The AttackState class has public variables for the target, attack ability, attack range, and attack interval. There is a private variable for the next attack time. The AttackState class overrides three methods from the AIState base class: EnterState, UpdateState, and ExitState. At the beginning of the EnterState method, the next attack time is set to the current time. In the UpdateState method, the AIController's attack method is called. The ExitState method has no implementation but is left as a placeholder for potential cleanup. The class is decorated with the CreateAssetMenu attribute that adds it to a menu for creating AI states.
