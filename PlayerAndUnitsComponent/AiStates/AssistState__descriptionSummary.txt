This code is in a file located at C:\Users\Toastbrot\Downloads\STRATEGY 01.04.2022\My project\Assets\Scripts\PlayerAndUnitsComponent\AiStates\AssistState.cs. It is a script that defines an AI state called "AssistState". This state has a public "target" variable which is of type Transform, an "assistAbility" of type Ability, and an "assistRange" float variable. The "EnterState" and "ExitState" methods are empty, but the "UpdateState" method gets the distance between the AI controller's position and the target's position using Vector3.Distance and assigns it to the "distanceToTarget" variable. If the distance is less than or equal to the "assistRange", the AI controller uses the "assistAbility" by calling the "UseAbility" method of the "AbilityController" component. Otherwise, the AI controller changes its state to the "followState".
