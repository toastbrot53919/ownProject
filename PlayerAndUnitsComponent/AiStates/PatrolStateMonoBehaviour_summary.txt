This file is called PatrolStateMonoBehaviour. It is a script for managing the patrol behavior of an AI-controlled player unit in a Unity game. 
The script contains a public variable that holds an array of GameObjects representing the patrol waypoints for the unit. 
During gameplay, the unit will move between waypoints in the array to simulate patrolling behavior.

The implementation logic of this script is relatively simple. The script's main purpose is to store and manage the patrol waypoints for the unit. 
When the game begins, the script sets the first waypoint in the array as the unit's destination. 
As the unit moves towards the destination, the script checks if the unit has arrived at the waypoint. 
If the unit has reached the waypoint, the script sets the next waypoint in the array as the unit's destination. 
This loop continues until the unit has visited all the waypoints in the array or the game is ended. 

In summary, the PatrolStateMonoBehaviour script manages the patrol behavior of an AI-controlled player unit in a Unity game by storing an array of patrol waypoints and updating the unit's destination to the next waypoint in the array as the unit reaches each waypoint in the patrol.
