Class: FollowState

- Inherits from: AIState

- Public Variables:
    - target: Transform - stores the target's transform
    - stoppingDistance: float - stores the distance at which the AI will stop following the target

- Methods:
  - EnterState(AIController aiController): override method that runs when the AI enters the FollowState. Takes an AIController parameter, but in this case does nothing.
  - UpdateState(AIController aiController): override method that runs every frame when the AI is in FollowState. Takes an AIController parameter.
        - Declare and initialize a float variable called distanceToTarget and set it to the distance between the AI's position and the target's position using Vector3.Distance() method.
        - Check if the distanceToTarget is greater than the stoppingDistance:
            - If it is, get the NavMeshAgent component attached to the AI via aiController.GetComponent<UnityEngine.AI.NavMeshAgent>(), and use the SetDestination() method to set the destination to the target's position.
            - If it is not, reset the path of the NavMeshAgent by using the ResetPath() method.
  - ExitState(AIController aiController): override method that runs when the AI exits FollowState. Takes an AIController parameter, but in this case does nothing.
