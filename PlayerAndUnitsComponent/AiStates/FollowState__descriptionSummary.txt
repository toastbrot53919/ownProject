This is a C# script named "FollowState" located in the "AiStates" folder of a Unity project. It is a subclass of "AIState" and has a public Transform variable named "target" and a public float variable named "stoppingDistance". The "EnterState" and "ExitState" methods are empty, but the "UpdateState" method calculates the distance between the AI controller's position and the target's position using Vector3.Distance and checks if it is greater than the stoppingDistance. If it is, then the NavMeshAgent component of the AI controller sets its destination to the target's position, otherwise it resets its path. This script can be used as a state for an AI system that needs to follow a designated target.
