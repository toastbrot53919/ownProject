This file contains an interface called IIsGrabable, which declares five methods. The first two methods are getters and setters for a boolean property called IsGrabbed and a Transform property called Grabber. The last two methods are called Grab and Release, which are responsible for controlling the state of an object as it is grabbed and released. The Grab method takes a Transform parameter for the object that is doing the grabbing, and the Release method has no parameters.
