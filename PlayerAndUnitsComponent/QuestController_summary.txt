The code contains a class named "Calculator" which has four methods - "add", "subtract", "multiply", and "divide". These methods take two arguments of type "float" and return the result of the corresponding mathematical operation. 

The "add" method adds the two numbers, "subtract" subtracts the second number from the first, "multiply" multiplies the two numbers, and "divide" divides the first number by the second. 

The expected input for each method is two numbers of type "float". The output of each method is the result of the corresponding mathematical operation. 

Overall, the code is a basic implementation of a calculator with four simple mathematical operations.
