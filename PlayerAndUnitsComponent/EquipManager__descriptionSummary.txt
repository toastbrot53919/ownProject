It contains a class called EquipManager that inherits from MonoBehaviour and can be serialized. The class has an enum called EquipmentType that defines various equipment types. It also has a Dictionary called equippedItems that maps EquipmentType to EquipableItem.

The class also has public properties that store the total stats from all equipped items, such as TotalStatModier, TotalStrength, TotalIntelligence, TotalDexterity, TotalEndurance, and TotalWisdom.
