The "VisualEffectManager.cs" file is a scriptable object that manages a list of visual effects. It contains a struct called "VisualEffect" which consists of an effect name and a game object for the effect. The scriptable object has a public list of VisualEffect objects. It also has a public method called "GetEffectPrefab" which takes in an effect name and searches for a matching VisualEffect in its list. If found, it returns the corresponding effect game object. If not found, it logs an error message and returns null.
